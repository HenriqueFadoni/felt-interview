# Felt Interview Project

## Thought Process

and feel similar for the later integration process. After that, I uploaded the layout screen to sketch in order to
find the proper colors to use in the project. Besides, unfortunately, I couldn't find the Font Family.

Later on, I started sketching in a piece of paper the file structure. I looked like this at first:

At the end this was the result side by side with the layout:
